                   <h2>  <u> Basic Rules:</u> </h2>                   
                    A match involves batting and bowling innings for both teams.
                    The team batting tries to score runs by hitting the ball and running between two sets of stumps, while the bowling team tries to dismiss the batsmen.
                    Runs can be scored by hitting the ball and running between the stumps, hitting boundaries (four or six runs), or through penalties awarded by the umpires.
                    The team with the most runs at the end of the match or the specified number of overs wins.
                    <br>

                   <u> Batsmen</u>: Score runs for the team by hitting the ball.
                    <u>Bowlers:</u> Try to dismiss batsmen by delivering the ball to hit the stumps or induce mistakes.

                    <u>Dismissals:
                    
                    <u>Bowled</u>: The ball hits the stumps, dislodging the bails.
                    <u>Caught</u>: The batsman hits the ball, and it is caught by a fielder without the ball touching the ground.
                    <u>LBW (Leg Before Wicket)</u>: The batsman is out if the ball, in the opinion of the umpire, would have hit the stumps but instead hits the batsman's leg.
                    <u>>Run Out</u>: A batsman is out if at any time while the ball is in play, they are out of their ground and their wicket is fairly put down by the opposing side.
